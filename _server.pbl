description="Elensefar has been overrun by orcs, now you had to gather an army to sucessfull retake it.

Non-linear seafaring campaign â€” small armies, tiny maps and refreshing new game mechanics.

Intermediate Level, 22 optional scenarios (about 12 to play)

Saving Elensefar was orginally by turin and trewe. Saving Elensefar Redux is a fork from the latest available version by trewe."
