            story= _ "Meneldur, Black the Red, and Madru went to the Elensian palace, and searched the dungeons for prisoners taken by the orcs. They found many of the old nobility there, including the man who had been the Lord of Elensefar, Sir Darahan of Wesnoth. Having been taken captive immediately after the city was sacked, he had no knowledge of what had occurred in the many months since then."

        [part]
            story= _ "The three rescuers told him their tale, of how Elensefar was no longer a province of Wesnoth, and of how Undead were temporarily 'living' in the city. He had been a loyal supporter of the throne before his captivity, and while in prison he had been constantly expecting Wesnoth to come and free him. Until he was told of Wesnoth's betrayal, he had believed that it was men of Wesnoth who had come in from the sea to attack the city, men of Wesnoth who had been fighting in the streets to reach the orcish leader, men of Wesnoth who had finally come to unlock his cell door. Needless to say, he felt betrayed."
