It is the story of a time of great forgetfulness, when much of what was once known had been forgotten, but also of great knowledge. It is the story of Meneldur the Mariner, who used the newfound knowledge to resurrect some of the old. But, it is, most of all, the story of the voyage of his ship, and what he encountered while traveling the high seas..."

            story= _ "Before the tale begins, it is important to know that none of the seafaring men or elves, including Meneldur, were willing to travel far out of sight of the coast. Instead, they remained near land, and sailed only north and south, for they dimly remembered tales from Haldric's day, of dragons, and sea serpents, and snake-men, who lurked on the islands that lay to the west of the continent."

            story= _ "Meneldur was born in the northlands, in Wesmere, but was outcast from the elvish lands because of a conflict with the High Council. Thus, although an elf, Meneldur had pledged his loyalty to Elensefar, and thus to Wesnoth (but, significantly, not to Weldyn)."

When Meneldur had landed in Elensefar, he went to the castle to recieve directions from the Lord of Elensefar as to where his new voyage was to be to. He was to travel south to the Elven peninsula, and trade with the southern elves."
