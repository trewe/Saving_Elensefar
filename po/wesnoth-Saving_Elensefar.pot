It is the story of a time of great forgetfulness, when much of what was once known had been forgotten, but also of great knowledge. It is the story of Meneldur the Mariner, who used the newfound knowledge to resurrect some of the old. But, it is, most of all, the story of the voyage of his ship, and what he encountered while traveling the high seas..."

Instead, they remained near land, and sailed only north and south, for they dimly remembered tales from Haldric's day, of dragons, and sea serpents, and snake-men, who lurked on the islands that lay to the west of the continent."

When Meneldur had landed in Elensefar, he went to the castle to recieve directions from the Lord of Elensefar as to where his new voyage was to wend.
